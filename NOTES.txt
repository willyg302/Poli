To start the emulator: navigate to SDK Tools directory, run "android avd"
To start debugger: navigate to SDK Tools directory, run "ddms"

To start SQLite shell:
	Navigate to SDK platform-tools directory, run "adb shell"
	"cd data"
	"cd data"
	"cd com.hichi.androidapp2" (or the app name, whatever it is)
	run "sqlite3 tablenamehere.db"

Sometimes the emulator drops and is not recognized by DDMS or Netbeans. To restart:
	Navigate to SDK platform-tools directory
	"adb kill-server"
	"adb start-server"

It also helps to wipe user data when stuff starts to go wrong (when starting emulator through AVD)
